Control Flow
Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script
goes to the function to the scripts you wrote, the way how the computer runs the code
Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line unless the computer runs across the structures that change the control flow such as conditionals and loops
If a script used to validate data from a webpage form, the script will submit validated data but what if users want to leave a empty field, the script prompts them to fill it in.
To do that the script uses a conditional structure or if...else
for example:
if (isEmpty(field)) {
    promptUser();
} else {
    sumbitForm();
}
 The function could also include a loop, which iterates through all of the fields in the form, checking each one in turn. 
 Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

 JavaScript Functions
 A Javascript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task
 JavaScript function is executed when something invokes it
 similar to algebra equations
 assignment operate adds value to the variable
 equality means it equals the same
