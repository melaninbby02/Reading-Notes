Growth Mindset
A growth mindset to me is seeing what and where I am lacking of something and then getting into the root of it and making that room of improvement
Also dedicating my time to what I need to improve on to become a better individual and to make things easier when the time comes for what I was working on
I would say some of my top strenghs in growth would be is being able to adapt to change whether its the environment or the working settings I'm
Just having that positive mindset to be able to go with the work flow
my other thing is having constant improvement and continuously investing in yourself for the better you and the future
then my last thing is being open to receiving feedback on any assignments, projects and anything of that sort and not thinking of just the negative things
Some of the areas  need to improve on is having ambition and initiative in myself knowing that I have the drive to learn more things and having more solutions then just one in mind
Another thing is having ambiguity when it comes to me understanding my assignment and making sure I'm doing my part of trying to understand what I'm getting out of the lesson for that day, and being confident in my own answers as well
Lastly something I need to improve on is having a curious mindset of what I'm learning and paying more attention so can I have more questions to ask whenever I feel like I'm stuck on something I would already have an Idea on exackly how do I need to work through it.
